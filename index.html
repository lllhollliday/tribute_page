            Ziggy Stardust, the most well known character, was created by David
            Bowie for the 1972 concept album: The Rise and Fall of Ziggy
            Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. The character is an alien sent
            to earth, to bring a positive message of hope in the last five years
            of its existence. David Bowie played as the character on the tour of
            the same name, and retired it on stage in July 1973.

            Bowie portrayed the thin white duke persona from 1975 to 1976. The
            character appears in the 1976 album Station to Station, in the film:
            The Man Who Fell To Earth, on the 1976 Isolar tour, on the cover of
            the album Low and in the song Lazarus as a final goodbye to the
            character. Bowie played this character at the peak of his drug use
            while living in Los Angeles. The character was known for pro-fascist
            statements made in interviews.

            Halloween Jack was created for the 1974 Diamond Dogs album and tour.
            He appears on the front cover of the album, and is mentioned in the
            songs. He is described as being a "real cool cat" who lives in
            Hunger City. Some of this is inspired by the novel: 1984 by George
            Orwell. He has a very similar appearance to the other personas Ziggy
            Stardust and Aladdin Sane - all three had shaved eyebrows and a red
            mullet haircut. David appeared as this persona in the Diamond Dogs
            recording sessions and early 1974 interviews, before changing into
            the more Soul Man-ish appearance for the tour and rest of the year.

            The Soul Man was created for the Diamond Dogs tour. Specifically for
            the soul part of the tour, that included songs from the then
            forthcoming, R&B and soul album: Young Americans. However, his first
            appearance was as a DJ in the song Starman From The Rise and Fall of
            Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. It wasn't until David got
            cast to be in the movie: The Man Who Fell To Earth, that The Soul
            Man was retired.
